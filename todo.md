# To Do

### Emplec
~~* Game reviews (with spam/curses filter and star rating?)~~
* Add game request system that will automatically forward it to ajh10@yandex.com (Low Priority)
* Automatically assign ID in games.json as game title with scrambled letters (Optional, not needed at all really lol)
* ~~**If possible**, fix "CSRF validation invalid" when logging in from one of the alt links that iframes this (links page for reference) (Hi Priority)~~ Sadly cannot be fully fixed due to Google's login page using iFrame protection.
* **If possible**, add a development server before actual changes get published (Optional)
* ~~**If possible**, hide the Duck Life games for now, the embeds don't work (Med. Priority)~~

### Ajh
* Fix Duck Life games (Med. Priority)
* Add tiktok, discord, geforce, fortnite
* Add apps page with apps.json, similar to games page
